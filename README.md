I will try my best to translate the articles in the [blog](https://tenthousandmeters.com/) to chinese which writen by [Victor](https://tenthousandmeters.com/about/). 
If I have finished translating a article, I will take a tick in the front of the article name. 
And you would find the translating in the directory: **Source**.

Also you could point out my mistakes in the translation or in the understanding of the context. It is glad to get your words and please contact me by E-mail:2410520561@qq.com.
